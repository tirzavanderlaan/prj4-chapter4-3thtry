<h1>When is art considered art?</h1>

<p>As an art lover, all styles and types of art are adored. If it's either abstract, highly detailed or free for imagination, in many occasions appreciate like it. With so much to explore there is always an art piece which fit to you. However, being critical is also necessary. Lately, I'm asking myself; "Is this art? Could this be considered as 'the art piece'? Or is this painted by my best friends nephew? The little one that has no control over its crayons and doodles around in its daydream?" Maybe. Or maybe I'm just jealous this toddlers art piece is worth a thousand.</p>
